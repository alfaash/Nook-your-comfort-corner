🌿 Nook - Your Comfort CornerAn intelligent wellness companion that bridges the gap between digital work and physical well-being.📖 About The ProjectNook is a web-based mobile application designed to monitor your physical environment and mental state in real-time. By leveraging device sensors (accelerometer & gyroscope) and Microsoft Azure AI, Nook detects posture fatigue, movement anomalies, and anxiety-induced jitter, transforming your workspace into a true "comfort corner."Unlike standard fitness trackers, Nook focuses on "Ambient Wellness"—monitoring your well-being non-intrusively while you work or study, providing empathetic nudges and emergency alerts when needed.✨ Key Features📍 Real-Time Motion Analysis: Captures device motion data at 60Hz, averages it locally to preserve privacy, and detects posture shifts or sudden falls.🧠 AI Anomaly Detection: Integrates Azure Anomaly Detector to identify irregular movement patterns indicative of high stress or physical distress.🎙️ Voice Journaling: Uses Azure AI Speech and Language Services to analyze the sentiment of daily audio logs.🛡️ Automated Safety Net: Instantly notifies emergency contacts via SMS if a severe anomaly (e.g., a fall) is detected.🔐 Secure & Private: built with JWT Dual-Token authentication and password encryption.🛠️ Tech StackBackendRuntime: Node.js & Express.jsDatabase: MongoDB (Time Series Data optimized)Authentication: JWT (Access + Refresh Tokens) & BcryptjsValidation: Mongoose MiddlewareAI & Cloud (Microsoft Azure)☁️ Azure Anomaly Detector: For identifying motion irregularities.☁️ Azure AI Speech: For converting voice journals to text.☁️ Azure OpenAI: For generating empathetic, context-aware user feedback.FrontendCore: HTML5 / JavaScript (DeviceMotion API)Data Handling: Client-side "Bucket" buffering to optimize network requests.⚙️ Architecture WorkflowData Collection: Frontend captures Accelerometer/Gyroscope data.Preprocessing: Data is averaged every 10 seconds to filter noise.Transmission: Secure API calls send batched data to the Node.js backend.Analysis: Backend relays data to Azure Anomaly Detector; simultaneous storage in MongoDB.Feedback: If an anomaly is found, an alert is pushed to the client or emergency contacts.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesNode.js (v14+)MongoDB (Local or Atlas URI)Microsoft Azure Account (for API keys)InstallationClone the repositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/nook-backend.git
